# There are so many open source functions available developed by several programmers. We can use them rather than developing our own function.

# If we want to print the value of pi then we will import the math library.
import math
print("The value of pi is", math.pi)

# For statistics
import statistics
x=(359,560,560,130,780,479,189)
print(statistics.mean(x))
x=(210,280,298,500)
print(statistics.median_high(x))

# Important libraries:
# Numpy and Pandas
