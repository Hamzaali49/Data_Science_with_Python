print(age, type (int(age))) #we can also use this method to convert float into integer.

# if we put our age 18.5 (float) in the output, this will be wrong. To overcome this we always use flot in the command.

print(name, type(string(name))) #class is string
#Let's replace string with integer

# In type conversions, we can change the type of our variables as per requirement. 



# Practice

print(age, type(age))
# Class is string even we are putting integer. Let's change the class.
age=input("what is your age?")
